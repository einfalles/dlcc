- cannot get vue router to work properly when it is built and deployed to github pages. router link does not resolve to proper path
- got the router to work. had to use webpack and a really simple tutorial from scotch.io. now that the routes work, and the relatives path pretty much resolve, we need to see how to get data into the app. should the .json files be added to the statics folders in the docs directory? probably. could be a simple way to just fetch the data
- cannot figure out how to access the local json file...which directory is it in?
- how do i set up the router link so that you can view details on something you clicked? how to pass to the nested route
- how do i make the images from my notion public so i can show it on the site?
- how do i get daily to use the masonry layout?
- how do I get the funky layout of essays?
- how do i do lazy load? with images and with infinite scroll?
