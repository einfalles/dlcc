- cannot get vue router to work properly when it is built and deployed to github pages. router link does not resolve to proper path
- got the router to work. had to use webpack and a really simple tutorial from scotch.io. now that the routes work, and the relatives path pretty much resolve, we need to see how to get data into the app. should the .json files be added to the statics folders in the docs directory? probably. could be a simple way to just fetch the data
